     Returns a directory enumerator object that can be used to perform a deep enumeration of the directory at the specified URL.
     
     Because the enumeration is deep—that is, it lists the contents of all subdirectories—this enumerator object is useful for performing actions that involve large file-system subtrees. If the method is passed a directory on which another file system is mounted (a mount point), it traverses the mount point. This method does not resolve symbolic links or mount points encountered in the enumeration process, nor does it recurse through them if they point to a directory.
     
     For example, if you pass a URL that points to `/Volumes/MyMountedFileSystem`, the returned enumerator will include the entire directory structure for the file system mounted at that location. If, on the other hand, you pass `/Volumes`, the returned enumerator will include `/Volumes/MyMountedFileSystem` as one of its results, but will not traverse into the file system mounted there.
     
     The [FileManager.DirectoryEnumerator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager/directoryenumerator) class has methods for skipping descendants of the existing path and for returning the number of levels deep the current object is in the directory hierarchy being enumerated (where the directory passed to the method is considered to be level `0`).

     - Parameters:
        - url: The location of the directory for which you want an enumeration. This URL must not be a symbolic link that points to the desired directory. You can use the [resolvingSymlinksInPath()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url/resolvingsymlinksinpath()) method to resolve any symlinks in the URL.
        - mask: Options for the enumeration.
        - handler: An optional error handler block for the file manager to call when an error occurs. The handler block should return `true` if you want the enumeration to continue or `false` if you want the enumeration to stop.  If you specify `nil` for this parameter, the enumerator object continues to enumerate items as if you had specified a block that returned `true`. The block takes the following parameters:
            - url: A URL that identifies the item for which the error occurred.
            - error: The error:
     - Returns: An directory enumerator object that enumerates the contents of the directory at `url`. If `url` is a filename, the method returns an enumerator object that enumerates no files—the first call to [nextObject()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsenumerator/nextobject()) returns `nil`.
